A desktop-based application that provides an easy-to-use, yet highly secure, password management solution.
Users can use the application to generate strong passwords and save passwords for their personal accounts on websites and social applications.

## Problem:

-Using simple passwords that are easy to be hacked.

## Solution:
#### 1-generate password:
1. The unique in our password generation is that u can generate it in different types and its not totally random but composed of real words concatenated with number and special character.
2. The format of our resulted function is word-special character- word- 3 digits.
3.we have about 100 words, 10 special character and 100 numbers so we can produce about 100 million different password in the single category.



#### 2-save password
In our save password Page, the user can save multiple emails and password for the single application so that he can retrieve it anytime.
If the same user entered the same application and password the app will ask him if he wants to update this password or keep it.

#### 3-show saved passwords
In our show password page, the user enters the application that he saved its password then the app shows all the passwords that he has for that account.
